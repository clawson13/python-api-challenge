# WeatherPy & VacationPy

Prepared by Corey Lawson-Enos

## Summary
* WeatherPy: Study compares geographical latitude's effect on four weather categories--Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed. Includes Northern/Southern hemisphere comparison.
* VacationPy: Vacation planner for 500+ cities worldwide selected at random. Cites are mapped according to humidity level, including a final map with hotel pins for each city within temperate zone of 70-80Â° F, wind speed less than 10 mph, and zero cloudiness.  

## Technologies
Google Maps, OpenWeatherMap API, CitiPy, Pandas, NumPy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

## Additional Analysis
* Latitude did not show significant relationship to Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed categories. Sample humidity plot:

* Although northern latitude change shows a strong link to temperature, the tie is much weaker in the South; as such, it cannot be construed from the dataset generated that latitude is the only contributing factor to global temperature variance.

* Interactive Google Map displays VacationPy's plotted cities colored by humidity level:
