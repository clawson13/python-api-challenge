Homework for Boot Camp Week 5: Matplotlib; Submitted by Corey Lawson-Enos

## Summary
Pymaceuticals Inc.: Impact analysis of twelve drug regimens on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor volume over a period of 5 to 45 days, with a summary data focus on Capomulin (Pymaceuticals), Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.

## Technologies
Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

## Additional Analysis
* Capomulin's results appear to be one of the most effective treatments in reducing tumor size when compared to three peers--although Ramicane may have slightly better results. Average tumor volume for both Capomulin and Ramicane subjects remained lowest amongst all treatments too, both with the lowest SEM as well.

* Sample data for one mouse shows Capomulin may reduce tumor volume as much as 10% over a 45-day period.

* Per scatter plot data provided below, there appears to be a direct correlation between a mouse's weight and tumor volume: a measured correlation coefficient of 0.84.
